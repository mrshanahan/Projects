Projects
========

"Trying to complete over 100 projects in various categories in Python. Fork to learn any new language."

That's the idea; trying this out on my own (also on Python). I have some experience in Python doing very basic scripting
(especially with text, regex, and the SQLite API), but nothing on these sorts of scales, and especially (and crucially)
not with web or multithreaded applications.
